## About Drops LIMS

Drops LIMS is a web application for the management of clinical laboratories. Drops LIMS establishes well-defined processes in the area of your laboratory from the arrival of the patient to the delivery of results and even their follow-up. We facilitate the most common tasks that are often used in any laboratory, such as:

- Determinations grouped by Biochemical Nomenclator
- List of doctors and prescribers
- Internal worksheets for the laboratory
- Classification of protocols by billing periods
- Practices signed by the biochemical professional
- Generation of PDF reports and sending by email
- Monitoring of payments of social works
- Statistics on patient arrival, most attended social works, composition of patients by sex, billing monitoring, etc.
- Staff permissions
- System activity log and system logs

Drops LIMS is accessible, powerful, and provides the tools you need to bring that peace of mind to your lab.
