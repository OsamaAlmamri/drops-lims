## About Drops LIMS

Drops LIMS is a web application for the management of clinical laboratories. Drops LIMS establishes well-defined processes in the area of your laboratory from the arrival of the patient to the delivery of results and even their follow-up. We facilitate the most common tasks that are often used in any laboratory, such as:

- Internal worksheets for the laboratory
- Monitoring of social works debt
- Statistics on patient flow
- Generation of PDF reports
- User permissions for internal administration
- System activity log and system logs

Drops LIMS is accessible, powerful, and provides the tools you need to bring that peace of mind to your lab.
